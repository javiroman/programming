*Java Annotations* allow us to add metadata information into our source code,
although they are not a part of the program itself. Annotations were added to
the java from JDK 5.

Annotations, a form of metadata, provide data about a program that is not part
of the program itself. Annotations have no direct effect on the operation of
the code they annotate.

Annotations have a number of uses, among them:

- **Information for the compiler** — Annotations can be used by the compiler to
  detect errors or suppress warnings.
- **Compile-time and deployment-time processing** — Software tools can process
  annotation information to generate code, XML files, and so forth.
- **Runtime processing** — Some annotations are available to be examined at runtime.
